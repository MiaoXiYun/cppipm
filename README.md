cppipm
=====
C++ implementation of the Interior Point Method (CPPIPM)

### Requirements
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), "*a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms*". 
Eigen forms the linear algebra core of this software.

### How to use
QP:

```
  Algorithm* test = new cppipm(Q,A,b,c); test -> solve();
```

LP:

```
  Algorithm* test = new cppipm(A,b,c);  test -> solve(); 
```

Or:

```
  Algorithm* test = new cppipm(otherProblem);  test -> solve();
```

### Example
See test.cpp
